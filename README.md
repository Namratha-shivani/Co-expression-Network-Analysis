# Co-expression-Network-Analysis
Co-expression network analysis is a computational approach used in bioinformatics and systems biology to study the relationships between genes based on their expression patterns across multiple samples or conditions. It is helpful for

1. Identifying Functional Relationships
2. Understanding Regulatory Mechanisms
3. Biomarker Analysis
4. Comparitive Analysis
5. Integration with omics data
